# Poker

## Description

This is a project to calculate the probability of winning for each hand in a poker game. More information can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJhtip3de0g&t=813s). The idea is to perform the calculations in real time but for now it takes too long to calculate them and some hand checkers are not well defined. Also it is done in a notebook. The notebook can be found in the folder `notebooks`.

An example of probabilities for a game can be found in the next YouTube video:
